What is String?

String is a sequence of character.

A string always a written between '' , "" or ''' '''.

a = "welcome"

As we know thata python is zero indexing programming language.

Access Element in String:---------

str = 'veronica'

-8 -7 -6 -5 -4 -3 -2 -1
 v  e  r  o  n  i  c  a
 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8
 
 
 
 Slicing in String:-
 we use '+' operator for concatenation of two or more String
 
 str1 = 'hello!'
 str2 = 'world'
 
 print(str1+str2)
 
 Iterating using String:-
 
 If we want count sub-string from main-string it possible using for loop.
 
count = 0
a = "Hello"
for sub in a:
    if(sub == 'w'):
        count+=1
print(count)


String Membership test------->

In membership test we show that sub string is present in main string or not if sub string is present than output is True otherwise output is False.

print('a' in 'apple')
print('b' in 'apple')

Break Statement and Continue Statement

In Python, the break statement provides you with the opportunity to exit from loop when an external condition is reached.

We can put break statement with in the loop.
Generally break statement in apply just after if statement.

Continue Statement------------>

The continue statement gives you the option to skip a particular part of a loop where an external condition is reached.

The continue statement will be within the block of code under the loop statement, usually after a conditional if statement.
