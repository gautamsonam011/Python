What is Loop Statement?

When we want execute a block of code multiple time then we use loop statement.

Start
        Process will repeat until
        condition is not false

                                 Body of loop

Condition   If Loop condition is True


if loop condition false then it's exit



Types of Loop:-

1:- For Loop
2:- While Loop
3:- Nested Loop

While Loop:----

The while loop in python is used to iterate over a block of code as the test expression (condition) is True.

Syntax of while loop:-

while(condition):
    statement...
    condition control statement
    
                       Enter while loop
    
                       check condition     False
            
 Process will repeat until      True
 condition is not false          
 
                            Body of While Loop    Exit from loop
                            
                            
a = 0
while a<10:
    print(a)
    a = a+1
    
    
    
For Loop:---

When we want execute a block od code in given range than we use for loop.

In for loop interpreter check always last condition of range when this condition is reach then for loop is terminate.


                Each Item in sequence
                
                Check last element of sequence     Yes
                
                            No
                            
                            Body of for            Exit from loop
                            
                            


range() function:---

When we want to generate a sequence of number in python with for loop then we use range() function. range() function is always generate a integer number.

How range() function work

1. With single argument:-

for a in range(5):
    print(a)
    
2. With double argument:-

for i in range(1,11):
        print(i)
        
3. With triple argument:-

for i in range(1,21,2):
        print(i)
        
4. Reverse range() function:-

When we want execute range() function in reverse then there is always pass three argument.

for a in range(10,0,-1):
            print(a)
            
            
For with datatypes:------------

A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary,a set, or string).

a = "Welcome to Here"

for s in a:
    print(s,end=",")
